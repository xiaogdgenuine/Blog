## Version 1.5.0：

I'm very sorry about taking so long yet just release a bug fix version, I'm still working on premier version.

For many reasons, I just can't done anything in the right time frame, always keep postpone schedules.

This year is definitely my toughest year so far, my dear father left me at a young age, 56. I still can't believe this just happened.

Anyway, life can be so suck, but one must fight back.

I will try to release regular bugfix versions before premier version is ready (let's try every 3 weeks first :)).
